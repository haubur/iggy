# Kafka gateway scope — [apache/iggy#3421](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3421)

## Issue #3421 — in scope (this iteration)

Foundation layer only: a TCP listener on the Kafka wire port that decodes requests, validates scoped API keys and versions, validates request wire formats, and returns stub responses. With a bridge, Produce writes to Iggy and ListOffsets reads offsets from it.

**Stub semantics (important):** without a bridge, every API answers with a stub. Produce discards the payload and answers with retriable `NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER` (6). CreateTopics validates the request but answers `NOT_CONTROLLER` (41), so clients do not believe topics were created. Do not read `ec=0` from a stub as durable storage. Produce is the one API that stores real data once you configure a bridge ([#3535](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3535)).

Source of truth for supported ranges: `SUPPORTED_RANGES` in [`src/protocol/api.rs`](../src/protocol/api.rs).

### Governance model

Expand `SUPPORTED_RANGES` only after a key/version pair is manually tested. ApiVersions advertises exactly what the firewall allows.

**Every unsupported-version case closes the connection, for every listed key** - not just above
the encoder max. `kafka_protocol`'s schema floor for each of the six supported messages happens
to equal `SUPPORTED_RANGES`' own min today (Produce 3, Fetch 4, ListOffsets 1, Metadata 0,
ApiVersions 0, CreateTopics 2), so there is no version below an API's min that the crate can
actually encode a response for either - `unsupported_version_response` still tries, but the
encode attempt fails and the connection closes rather than sending a malformed body.
**ApiVersions is the sole exception** (KIP-511): out of range still answers with a v0 error body,
because a client probing an unknown server must be able to parse the discovery response before
it knows the server supports flexible encoding.

## Supported API keys and versions

| API key | Name | Min version | Max version | Valid versions | Behavior |
| --------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| 18 | ApiVersions | 0 | 3 | 0, 1, 2, 3 | Advertise supported ranges; flexible encoding at v3+ |
| 3 | Metadata | 0 | 9 | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 | Decode topic list count; stub broker host from `advertised_host` or the bound `local_addr` IP; flexible encoding at v9+ |
| 0 | Produce | 3 | 9 | 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 | With a bridge: one `send_messages` per partition. Without one: stub returns `NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER` (6) |
| 1 | Fetch | 4 | 12 | 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 | Decode request; stub response |
| 2 | ListOffsets | 1 | 6 | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 | Decode request; stub response |
| 19 | CreateTopics | 2 | 5 | 2, 3, 4, 5 | Decode request; stub returns `NOT_CONTROLLER` (41); `-1` partitions/RF = broker default on v4+ |

A request is accepted when `min_version ≤ api_version ≤ max_version` for that API key. Any other version for a listed key closes the connection (ApiVersions excepted - see Governance model above). Any unlisted API key also closes the connection: no api-specific response schema exists for it, so any body this gateway could send would be misparsed by the client against the schema it expected.

### Valid versions reference (by API key)

Use this table when configuring clients or generating wire fixtures with `kafka-message-gen`.

| API key | Name | Valid versions (inclusive range) | Flexible wire encoding from |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0 | Produce | 3–9 | v9 |
| 1 | Fetch | 4–12 | v12 |
| 2 | ListOffsets | 1–6 | v6 |
| 3 | Metadata | 0–9 | v9 |
| 18 | ApiVersions | 0–3 | v3 |
| 19 | CreateTopics | 2–5 | v5 |

## Unsupported API keys (foundation)

All API keys not listed above close the connection (see Governance model above) - none receives an `UNSUPPORTED_VERSION` response. Examples not in this foundation scope:

| API key | Name | Notes |
| --------- | ------ | ------- |
| 8 | OffsetCommit | Consumer group — later issue |
| 9 | OffsetFetch | Consumer group — later issue |
| 10 | FindCoordinator | Consumer group — later issue |
| 11–16 | JoinGroup, Heartbeat, LeaveGroup, SyncGroup, DescribeGroups, ListGroups | Consumer group — later issue |
| 17 | SaslHandshake | Implemented behind `IGGY_KAFKA_SASL_ENABLED`, advertised only while it is on ([`AUTHENTICATION.md`](AUTHENTICATION.md)) |
| 20+ | DeleteTopics, InitProducerId, transactions, ACLs, etc. | Later issues |

## Architecture (three layers)

| Layer | #3421 | Description |
| ------- | ------- | ------------- |
| **1 — Wire framing** | In scope | `server.rs` — custom, zero-copy frame I/O; `header.rs` delegates version selection to `kafka_protocol::messages::ApiKey` |
| **2 — Request/response codecs** | Partial | Decode/encode via the `kafka_protocol` crate (broker feature only) for 6 hot-path keys; `bounds_guard.rs` pre-validates against unbounded allocation before handing a frame to the crate; stub responses except Produce and ListOffsets with a bridge |
| **3 — Iggy bridge** | Produce and ListOffsets wired | `bridge/` module (connection, topic mapping, provisioning, high watermark, `topic_target` + `send_records`). Produce ([#3535](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3535)) and ListOffsets ([#3537](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3537)) call it. Fetch does not call it yet ([#3536](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3536)) |

## TODO — post-#3421 (architecture review backlog)

Items from the [hybrid architecture review](https://github.com/apache/iggy/discussions/3252) and maintainer feedback. **Not part of #3421.**

### Phase 2 — Iggy bridge

[#3533](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3533) landed the bridge module itself; the items
below it are still open for the issues that build on top of it.

- [x] Add `bridge/` module (`iggy_bridge`) - connection lifecycle, topic mapping, provisioning,
      high watermark, error mapping. See [README.md](../README.md#iggy-bridge-3533).
- [x] Produce → `send_messages` ([#3535](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3535)) - one call
      per partition, base offset from the send confirmation, one error code per partition. See
      [README.md](../README.md#produce-3535).
- [ ] Produce: `IggyClient` pool. Pin each partition to one client, so order holds.
- [ ] Produce: write keyed records' header TLVs into one buffer (`records::to_iggy`). Benchmark
      first. Keep Iggy's TLV layout and the 100 KB header check.
- [ ] Produce: skip the second batch CRC pass (`records::preflight`) only if profiling shows it
      matters. A corrupt header must still answer 87.
- [ ] Produce stub, `acks=0`: close the connection when the request names a partition, as Kafka
      does. v0-2 needs the counts read from the raw body.
- [ ] Fetch → `poll_messages` ([#3536](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3536)).
- [x] Idempotent `ensure_stream_and_topic()` (create-if-not-exists) - `src/bridge/iggy_bridge.rs`,
      exercised end-to-end in `tests/bridge_iggy_integration_tests.rs`.
- [x] Real CreateTopics ([#3538](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3538)): with
      `IGGY_KAFKA_BRIDGE_ENABLED=true`, creates the Iggy stream/topic through
      `IggyBridge::create_kafka_topic` - an atomic create-or-report-exists call, not a separate
      existence read followed by an idempotent create (that sequence has a TOCTOU window: two
      concurrent requests for the same new name could both observe "doesn't exist yet" and both
      receive `NONE`, when Kafka guarantees exactly one caller does).
      `src/protocol/handlers/create_topics.rs`, `tests/create_topics_real_bridge_tests.rs`. With
      the bridge off, the stub from #3421 answers `NOT_CONTROLLER` (41) as before.
  - Every occurrence of a duplicate topic name within one request is rejected with
    `INVALID_REQUEST` (42) and nothing is created for it, matching real Kafka
    (`ControllerApis.createTopics`) rather than creating the first occurrence and reporting the
    rest as already existing.
  - A manual partition `assignments` list combined with an explicit `num_partitions`/
    `replication_factor` is rejected with `INVALID_REQUEST` (42) even when the count agrees with
    `assignments.len()` - real Kafka's own `ReplicationControlManager` treats the two as mutually
    exclusive inputs, not independently-checked values that happen to agree.
  - A manual assignment's own partition indices are checked too, not just its length:
    `ERROR_INVALID_REPLICA_ASSIGNMENT` (39) for a duplicate index or one that isn't exactly
    `0..assignments.len()` - `{5: [...], 7: [...]}` has the right length for a 2-partition topic
    but names neither partition `0` nor `1`, matching real Kafka's own
    `ReplicationControlManager.createTopic` key-set validation.
  - `IggyError::RequestAlreadyApplied` (the SDK's reconnect path replayed a write that already
    committed) maps to `NONE`, not the `UNKNOWN_SERVER_ERROR` catch-all - the operation did
    succeed, and a Java client treats `UNKNOWN_SERVER_ERROR` as non-retriable. Special-cased
    locally in `create_topics.rs`, not in the shared `BridgeError -> Kafka error code` mapping
    every handler's error path goes through: "the write already applied" is a write-only fact,
    and a read (Metadata, ListOffsets) reaching this variant has no write to have applied.
  - `error_message` on a rejected topic never re-embeds the topic name `CreatableTopicResult.name`
    already carries - `BridgeError::InvalidKafkaTopicName`'s `Display` does, so using it directly
    would roughly double the response cost per invalid name, for free (name validation runs before
    any bridge I/O).
  - `IggyBridge::get_kafka_topic` no longer probes `get_stream` separately before `get_topic` -
    `get_topic` already answers `Ok(None)` when the stream itself is missing, so the probe was a
    second round trip to learn something the one call already told it.
  - Bridge fan-out is bounded independently of `bounds_guard`'s `MAX_REQUEST_ELEMENTS` (4,096,
    still a pre-decode ceiling, not a usability one): a duplicate name never reaches the bridge at
    all (rejected up front, see above), a request naming more than 100 distinct non-duplicate
    topics is rejected outright (`INVALID_REQUEST`, no bridge call for any of them), and the
    request's own wire `timeout_ms` (clamped to `[1s, 30s]`) now bounds the whole handler's
    aggregate bridge work, not just decoded and discarded - a deadline that fires answers every
    topic `REQUEST_TIMED_OUT` rather than continuing to hold the shared lockstep `IggyClient`.
- [x] Document partition mapping in [`BRIDGE_MAPPING.md`](BRIDGE_MAPPING.md):
  - Iggy partitions are **0-based** (same as Kafka) — direct `partition_id` mapping, no offset conversion
  - Kafka consumer groups do **not** map onto Iggy consumer groups. Assignment stays client-side, and Iggy's group registry is used as an offset key only ([`OFFSET_STORAGE.md`](OFFSET_STORAGE.md))
  - `Partitioning::partition_id(index)` on every Produce. A Kafka producer resolves the partition before it builds the request, so `Partitioning::balanced()` has no trigger there. The `-1` default-partition-count case belongs to CreateTopics
- [x] Real Metadata topic/partition data ([#3534](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3534)):
      with `IGGY_KAFKA_BRIDGE_ENABLED=true`, a named lookup answers from
      `IggyBridge::get_kafka_topic` (`UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION` if not found) and a null
      topics array ("all topics") answers from `IggyBridge::list_kafka_topics` - the target of
      every configured `TopicMapping` override plus every other topic in the default stream, so
      an Iggy stream this bridge has no mapping rule pointing at is never listed (nothing a Kafka
      client ever named). Every reported partition names this gateway's single broker (node id 1)
      as leader/replica/ISR, since there is only ever one. `src/protocol/handlers/metadata.rs`,
      `src/bridge/iggy_bridge/topics.rs` (`get_kafka_topic`/`list_kafka_topics`),
      `tests/metadata_real_bridge_tests.rs`. With the bridge off, the stub from #3421 reports
      every requested topic unknown, as before.
  - Fixed alongside: the stub's `decode_topics` collapsed a null topics array ("all topics") and
    an explicit empty one (`Some(vec![])`, "these zero topics") to the same `Vec::new()` - the
    real path's `decode_requested_topics` keeps `Option<Vec<_>>` so the two aren't conflated.
    Also: at `api_version == 0` an explicit empty array is folded into "all topics" too, matching
    Kafka's own `isAllTopics()` rule (`topics == null || (topics.isEmpty() && version == 0)`) -
    there is no v0 wire shape for "cluster info only, zero topics" (that distinct shape, KIP-4's
    `describeCluster()`, starts at v1).
  - `get_kafka_topic` shares its implementation with CreateTopics' own existence check above -
    both need "does this Kafka-side name resolve to a real Iggy topic," so this bridge exposes one
    method returning the SDK's own `TopicDetails`, not two narrower, independently-maintained
    lookups.
  - The response-size cap above only covers the "all topics" and per-name-expansion cases. A
    named lookup is separately bounded on the request side: names repeated in one request are
    deduped up front to one response entry, not just one bridge round trip - real Kafka answers a
    topic named twice in one request with one response entry, and re-expanding to match the
    request would let a handful of repeats of one large topic name amplify a response sized off
    the repeat count instead of the distinct count. No cap on distinct names: `bounds_guard`'s
    `MAX_REQUEST_ELEMENTS` (4,096) is still the pre-decode ceiling, but `IggyBridge::get_kafka_topics`
    batches by the *stream* each name resolves to rather than paying one round trip per name, so
    the real bridge cost is bounded by distinct streams involved (config-time-bounded), not by
    how many names the client asks about. A per-name cap here previously permanently broke a
    long-lived Java producer once its `ProducerMetadata`'s cumulative tracked-topic set - resent
    in full on every refresh - crossed the cap: every later request answered every topic
    `INVALID_REQUEST`, and the producer had no way to shrink its own tracked set to recover. The
    whole lookup's aggregate bridge work still runs under a fixed 20s wall-clock deadline
    (`Metadata` carries no `timeout_ms` field in any version, unlike `CreateTopics`, so this cannot
    be client-honored) - a deadline that fires answers every name `REQUEST_TIMED_OUT` rather than
    continuing to hold the shared lockstep `IggyClient`.
  - The "all topics" path is server-driven, not client-count-driven, so it has no distinct-topic
    cap - only the response-size projection applies there, and it **truncates** rather than
    closes on overflow: `list_kafka_topics()`'s result is trimmed to as many whole topics (in
    listing order) as `max_frame_size` allows. Closing instead, as the named-lookup path still
    does, would make every all-topics Metadata call - the bootstrap/refresh shape both librdkafka
    and the Java client use - fail identically and permanently once the cluster's total partition
    count crosses the trip point, since that size is the catalog's own, not anything the
    requesting client chose or can shrink.
- [ ] Multi-broker topology (this gateway is, and will stay, a single logical broker - node id 1
      always leads every partition it reports; nothing here models an Iggy cluster as multiple
      Kafka-visible brokers)
- [ ] A raw/non-conformant client's extra trailing byte on some Metadata request shapes seen
      against real `kcat`/`librdkafka` traffic in earlier testing on a since-restructured branch -
      not reproduced or root-caused against the current `kafka_protocol`-based decode path in this
      session, so not carried forward as a fix here rather than guessed at. Needs fresh
      reproduction against a real `kcat` before it's re-closed.
- [x] Real ListOffsets ([#3537](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3537)): with
      `IGGY_KAFKA_BRIDGE_ENABLED=true`, `LATEST` answers from `IggyBridge::high_watermarks` and
      `EARLIEST` answers `0`. Any other requested timestamp (arbitrary-timestamp offset search,
      including `offsetsForTimes`/`by_duration` resets) is unsupported - Iggy exposes no
      per-message timestamp index - and answers `UNSUPPORTED_FOR_MESSAGE_FORMAT` (43) per
      partition rather than a fabricated offset; non-retriable, so a Java client resolves this
      immediately instead of spinning until `default.api.timeout.ms`.
      `src/protocol/handlers/list_offsets.rs`, `tests/list_offsets_real_bridge_tests.rs`. With the
      bridge off, the stub from #3421 answers `NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER` (6) as before.
  - `EARLIEST = 0` is real *only* for a partition this bridge has never had retention trim: Iggy
    tracks no rolling low-watermark distinct from partition creation, so once a partition is
    old enough for retention to purge its first segment, `0` names a log-start offset that no
    longer exists - a real consumer with `auto.offset.reset=earliest` seeks into a hole. Not
    fixable client-side; needs the bridge to expose a real start offset. Harmless *today* only
    because Fetch (`#3536`) is still a stub - nothing yet reads at the offset this returns.
  - Bridge fan-out is bounded independently of `bounds_guard`'s `MAX_REQUEST_ELEMENTS` (4,096,
    still a pre-decode ceiling, not a usability one): topic entries sharing a name are deduped to
    one `high_watermarks` call before any bridge work starts (a name repeated across request
    entries costs one round trip per entry), and a topic whose every partition asks for an
    unsupported timestamp skips the call entirely. A request naming more than 100 distinct topics
    resolves the first 100 and answers the rest `REQUEST_TIMED_OUT` (retriable) with no bridge call
    at all, so a client that retries only its still-erroring topics narrows below the cap on its
    own. The whole request's aggregate bridge work runs under one 20s wall-clock deadline
    (`ListOffsets` carries no `timeout_ms` field in any version this gateway supports, so this is a
    fixed ceiling, not a client-honored one), applied per topic rather than once around the whole
    batch: a topic already resolved when the deadline arrives keeps its real answer, and only the
    not-yet-started topics answer `REQUEST_TIMED_OUT`.
- [ ] Real Metadata topology (brokers, partitions, leaders) backed by Iggy state

### `kafka-protocol` crate adoption — superseded, done differently

This TODO originally proposed a selective, feature-gated adoption (`kafka-protocol-cold`)
alongside the hand-rolled `requests.rs`/`responses.rs` codecs, keeping custom code for the
Produce/Fetch hot paths. That hybrid approach was not taken: `kafka_protocol` (broker feature
only) now decodes/encodes all six supported message types wholesale, and the hand-rolled
`codec.rs`/`requests.rs` were deleted. RecordBatch bytes stay opaque (`Option<Bytes>`, never
decoded) on the Produce/Fetch hot paths, preserving the one property this TODO was protecting.
`bounds_guard.rs` covers the DoS-bound gap the crate itself leaves open (see Governance model
above).

- [ ] Consumer-group API keys (8–14, 10) and complex Metadata/FindCoordinator responses remain unimplemented (see Phase 3 below) - the crate can decode them when that phase starts

### Phase 3 — Consumer groups (~7 API keys)

Offset persistence design ([#3540](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3540)):
[`OFFSET_STORAGE.md`](OFFSET_STORAGE.md).

- [ ] OffsetCommit (8), OffsetFetch (9), FindCoordinator (10)
- [ ] JoinGroup (11), Heartbeat (12), LeaveGroup (13), SyncGroup (14)
- [ ] DescribeGroups (15), ListGroups (16) as needed by target clients

### Phase 3+ — Auth, admin, tuning

InitProducerId and idempotent producers
([#3545](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3545)): [`IDEMPOTENCE.md`](IDEMPOTENCE.md).

Authentication design ([#3549](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3549)):
[`AUTHENTICATION.md`](AUTHENTICATION.md).

- [x] SASL/PLAIN (17, 36), opt-in via `IGGY_KAFKA_SASL_ENABLED`, credentials verified against Iggy.
      Kept out of `SUPPORTED_RANGES` on purpose: the connection loop routes both keys through the
      SASL state machine before dispatch, so a gateway with the feature off advertises neither key
      and answers either one with `ILLEGAL_SASL_STATE` (34) and an empty mechanism list, keeping the
      connection rather than closing it as an unlisted key would. Enabling it later therefore cannot
      silently widen what an unauthenticated client may send. SCRAM is ruled out by Iggy's
      credential storage, not deferred
- [ ] TLS on the gateway listener, a prerequisite for using PLAIN outside a trusted network
- [ ] Tune `max_frame_size` per workload (Kafka defaults: ~1 MiB produce, ~50 MiB fetch; current default 8 MiB)
- [ ] Target **~15–20 API keys** total for a functional bridge — not all 74+ admin keys

### Open questions (ask maintainers before Phase 2)

- [X] Repo placement: `gateways/kafka/` in [apache/iggy](https://github.com/apache/iggy) vs separate proxy repo (affects workspace deps and CI)
- [ ] Confirm bridge dependency strategy ([Discussion #3081](https://github.com/apache/iggy/discussions/3081), [#3252](https://github.com/apache/iggy/discussions/3252))
