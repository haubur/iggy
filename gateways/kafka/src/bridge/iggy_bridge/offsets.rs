    /// Iggy topic `kafka_topic` maps to, in one round trip.
    ///
    /// Takes `kafka_topic`, not raw Iggy stream/topic names, and resolves it through the same
    /// [`TopicMapping`](crate::bridge::topic_map::TopicMapping) `ensure_stream_and_topic`
    /// uses - a caller (a future `ListOffsets` handler) only ever has the Kafka-side name, and a
    /// topic with a mapping override would silently query the wrong Iggy resource if this took
    /// Iggy-space names directly instead.
    ///
    /// One call to `get_topic`, not one per partition: a single Kafka `ListOffsets` request asks
    /// about many partitions of one topic at once (`ListOffsetsRequest.json`'s
    /// `Topics[] -> Partitions[]`), and `get_topic`'s decode already rebuilds and sorts the whole
    /// partition vector regardless of how many of them the caller wants
    /// (`wire_conversions.rs`) - a naive one-call-per-partition wrapper around a
    /// single-partition method would turn one Kafka request into N round trips and N times the
    /// decode work. Returns results in the same order as `partitions`.
    ///
    /// `i64`, not `u64`: the `ListOffsets` response field this exists to fill is `int64`
    /// (`ListOffsetsResponse.json`), so a future handler needs no cast at the wire boundary - the
    /// lossy conversion happens once, here (`Partition::current_offset` is `u64`; converted via
    /// `i64::try_from`, saturating to `i64::MAX` on the practically-unreachable overflow case
    /// rather than panicking or wrapping).
    ///
    /// `Partition::current_offset` is the offset of the *last written* message, not "next offset
    /// to produce" - confirmed against a live server (3 produced messages read back
    /// `current_offset == 2`). An empty partition has no last-written offset at all, so this
    /// needs a dedicated empty case rather than inferring it from `current_offset == 0` (also a
    /// fresh partition's default value, indistinguishable from "one message at offset 0").
    ///
    /// That empty case is `messages_count == 0 && current_offset == 0`, not `messages_count == 0`
    /// alone: retention cleanup decrements `messages_count`
    /// (`iggy_partition.rs::decrement_messages_count`) without rewinding `current_offset`, so a
    /// fully-purged but previously-produced-to partition would otherwise read as empty. This is
    /// still not exact: a partition whose *only* message, at offset 0, gets trimmed by the same
    /// retention pass reports `(messages_count, current_offset) == (0, 0)` too, so its watermark
    /// would read `1` then drop back to `0` - a real Kafka watermark never moves backward. Narrow
    /// (needs retention to fully empty a partition that only ever held one message) and not
    /// fixable client-side (`PartitionResponse` carries no frontier field to disambiguate it), but
    /// worth having on the record rather than only implicitly true of the check below.
    ///
    /// Not the same value as `Partition::mint_frontier` (the offset the *next* mint will take):
    /// after a crash-recovery reservation, the append point can sit above the committed frontier
    /// by the reservation's lease block, and neither value is on the wire to tell them apart. This
    /// is still correct for `ListOffsets` LATEST (defined in terms of the committed offset), but a
    /// future Produce handler must not use it to predict a base offset for a write in flight.
    ///
    /// Known remaining gap, not fixable client-side: `(0, 0)` is also what a stats-registry MISS
    /// reports (`responses.rs`'s `PartitionResponse` builder), indistinguishable on the wire from
    /// a genuinely empty partition. Narrow and self-healing - `partition_reconciler.rs`'s
    /// `settle_partition_stats` opens this only on the teardown-for-rebuild path, closing once the
    /// rebuild completes; deletes never open it. The real answer (`Partition::offset_frontier`)
    /// stays server-side and isn't in this response. The check matches the server's own
    /// `PartitionState::store_offset_range_error` condition, so it's not an invented heuristic - a
    /// future `ListOffsets` (`#3537`) built on this inherits the same blind spot.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Returns [`BridgeError::InvalidKafkaTopicName`] if `kafka_topic` fails Kafka's own
    /// topic-naming rules. Returns [`BridgeError::Timeout`] if the call takes longer than
    /// `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`. Returns [`BridgeError::Iggy`] if the mapped stream doesn't exist (see
    /// the note above on which resource is actually missing). These are call-level failures -
    /// nothing about any individual partition could be resolved. A single out-of-range
