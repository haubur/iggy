//! Packet simulation layer for deterministic network testing.
//!
//! This module provides a packet-level network simulator that models:
//! - Per-path latency with exponential delay distribution
//! - Packet loss and replay (duplication) at delivery time
//! - Automatic network partitioning with configurable lifecycle
//! - Automatic path clogging with exponential duration
//! - Link capacity limits with random eviction
//! - Per-command link filtering via `LinkFilter` (`EnumSet<Command>`)
//!
//! Partitions are implemented via per-link `LinkFilter`s. When a link's
//! filter is empty, all packets are silently dropped. When specific commands
//! are removed from the filter, only those command types are blocked.
//! External code can manipulate individual link filters via
//! [`PacketSimulator::link_filter`].
//!
//! # Delivery model
//!
//! This simulator uses **pull-based batch delivery**, [`PacketSimulator::step()`] returns
//! a `Vec<Packet>` containing all packets ready in the current tick. The caller
//! processes the batch after `step()` returns. This means packets delivered in
//! the same tick cannot trigger chain reactions within that tick.
